# Documentation: .env (Environment Configuration)

## Overview

The `.env` file is a standard environment configuration file used to store sensitive and environment-specific settings for the BGS Data backend and related services. It is loaded at runtime (typically via python-dotenv or similar libraries) to provide configuration values for Flask, database connections, API integrations, and external services. This approach keeps secrets and deployment-specific settings out of the source code and enables easy configuration changes per environment (development, staging, production).

## Main Components

### 1. Discord Webhook Configuration
- `DISCORD_BULLIS_WEBHOOK_PROD`: Discord webhook URL for sending notifications (e.g., tick announcements, summaries) to a specific channel. Used by various modules for Discord integration.

### 2. API and Server Metadata
- `API_VERSION_PROD`: The current production API version. Used for version checks and compatibility enforcement between clients and server.
- `SERVER_NAME_PROD`: Human-readable name for the server instance.
- `SERVER_DESCRIPTION_PROD`: Description of the server and its purpose.
- `SERVER_URL_PROD`: Public URL of the running Flask server instance.
- `FLASK_SERVER_URL_PROD`: Alternate or internal URL for the Flask server (may be used for internal API calls).

### 3. Inara API Integration
- `INARA_API_KEY`: API key for accessing the Inara API, used for synchronizing commander (Cmdr) profiles and related data.

### 4. BGS Tick Announcement
- `BGS_TICK_ANNOUNCEMENT`: Boolean flag to enable or disable BGS tick announcements (e.g., via Discord).

### 5. EDDN Database Configuration
- `EDDN_DATABASE`: SQLAlchemy database URI for the EDDN (Elite Dangerous Data Network) data store. Used by `eddn_client.py` and Flask endpoints to read system, faction, and conflict data. Example: `sqlite:///db/bgs_data_eddn.db`.

---

## Usage
- The `.env` file should be placed in the project root and never committed to version control (add to `.gitignore`).
- Loaded automatically by modules using `python-dotenv` or similar libraries.
- All sensitive keys (API keys, webhook URLs) should be kept secret and rotated as needed.
- Values can be overridden per environment (e.g., development, staging, production) by using different `.env` files or environment variable overrides.

---

## Extensibility
- New configuration keys can be added as needed for additional integrations or features (e.g., more webhooks, database URIs, feature flags).
- For multi-tenant setups, tenant-specific settings are typically stored in `tenant.json`, but global/shared settings remain in `.env`.

---

## See Also
- `tenant.json`: Per-tenant configuration (API keys, DB URIs, Discord webhooks, etc.)
- `app.py`: Main Flask application, loads and uses these environment variables
- `eddn_client.py`, `cmdr_sync_inara.py`, `fac_shoutout_scheduler.py`: Modules that use these settings for API and database access
